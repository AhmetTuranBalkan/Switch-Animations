<p><h4>Add Beautiful Customise Switch in your application to enhance your application UI and UX</h4></p>

___


<p>
From time to time I browse Dribbble to get inspiration from UI/UX designers. You often see non-native control elements in these designs. Some, such as checkboxes, have no native counterpart in UIKit while others like switches are— except they’re nearly impossible to customize. You cannot even change the size of a UISwitch. What if you need to implement a completely custom designed switch for your app like this one


If you wanted to implement any of these designs it would be a poor choice to subclass `UISwitch` as you can hardly customize the colours — aside from the on/off tint.
So I thought I would try to re-engineer the UISwitch so that I would have complete control over each aspect, making it easy to style in the future.Turns out its actually pretty easy (and a lot of fun!) to build these control elements from scratch. I even went so far as to add the ability to set on/off text or images. For those who don’t know, UISwitch has onImage and offImage which when set don’t do anything anymore.

So i take few of the Dribble switches Daily UI challenges as challenge and implemented them in this library.This library has cool and sophisticated animations,Designs and effects. Also, customizable properties can be tweaked behaviors and enhance your application UI cool. With this library, you can easily implement material design switch to your app.
