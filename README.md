From time to time I browse Dribbble to get inspiration from UI/UX designers. You often see non-native control elements in these designs. Some, such as checkboxes, have no native counterpart in UIKit while others like switches are— except they’re nearly impossible to customize. You cannot even change the size of a UISwitch. What if you need to implement a completely custom designed switch for your app like this one

If you wanted to implement any of these designs it would be a poor choice to subclass `UISwitch` as you can hardly customize the colours — aside from the on/off tint.
So I thought I would try to re-engineer the UISwitch so that I would have complete control over each aspect, making it easy to style in the future
